> [Wardley Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map) is a technique that helps you examine your environment, identify upcoming changes and properly choose your actions. By examining what is needed, what components will be in use, what are their dependencies and characteristics, you can build a visual representation of your world, play what-if games, and pick your direction and best actions to support it.

This is a list of useful Wardley mapping resources and examples. Short URL: [list.wardleymaps.com](https://list.wardleymaps.com). Contributions welcome! [Contribution guidelines](https://list.wardleymaps.com/contributing) for adding something to the list.

Full source code and data provided in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tractorjuice/STMemGPT). Recall Memory: This is my short-term memory where I keep recent interactions. Core Memory: This is where I store key details about my persona and about you, the user. This gives me a 'personality' and allows for more personalized conversation. Archival Memory: This is my long-term memory where I store information that doesn't fit into core memory but is essential to remember. It's infinite in size, and I usually page through it to find answers to your questions. These parts work together to help the AI Assistant remember prior engagements, learn from them, and refer back when needed.
